let eggs = "Eggs"
let milk = "Milk"
let cheese = "Cheese"
let bread = "Bread"
let rice = "Rice"
let newLine = "\n"
//: - callout(Exercise): Create a string variable with an initial value of `""`. Add each constant item above to the list, one at a time. Add a `newLine` in between each item. Remember you can join two strings using the `+` operator.
// My code
var list = ""
list += eggs
list += newLine
list += milk
list += newLine
list += cheese
list += newLine
list += bread
list += newLine
list += rice

print(list)
